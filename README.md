# We are migrating (Work In-Progress)
As we are growing and building multiple accelerators, we started the work to separate the current repository "Microsoft/Dynamics-365-Industry-Accelerators" into multiple repositories based on the business verticals. here are the below new Industry accelerator repositories reference.

| Industry Accelerators | Description |
|-------------|----------------------|
| [Health Accelerator](https://github.com/Microsoft/Industry-Accelerator-Health) |  Rapidly develop healthcare solutions using FHIR entities such as patient, condition, and care plan. The Microsoft Health Accelerator enables partners and customers to create new use cases and workflows using a FHIR-based data model. Get more details from [Dynamics 365 ISV Success community](https://community.dynamics.com/365/b/dynamics365isvsuccess)|
| [Nonprofit Accelerator](https://github.com/Microsoft/Industry-Accelerator-Nonprofit) |  Rapidly develop nonprofit fundraising, grant/award and program/results management solutions.The Microsoft Nonprofit Accelerator enables partners and customers to create new integrated use cases and workflows across the funding to outcomes cycle.

# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Announces Industry Accelerators

Dynamics 365 announced the Microsoft Power Platform, a connected app platform 
that unifies access to your data to enable ISVs, SIs, Partners and Customers to build intelligent, 
data driven, task focused business and analytic applications. Microsoft is focused on enabling a data 
culture where the Microsoft Power Platform acts as the glue across Dynamics 365 (CE, F&O, Talent), 
Office 365 (SharePoint, Teams), Power BI, Power Apps, Microsoft Flow, Azure and other 3rd party on-premise 
and cloud based solutions.

# Introducing

With the Power Platform providing a unified approach to building data driven solutions, the team is taking 
it one step further by introducing Industry Solution Accelerators. Accelerators are industry focused foundational 
components that enable ISVs and other solution providers, a way to build solutions that are based on industry 
standards supported and driven by Microsoft. Along with our Health Accelerator that was released during Inspire 2018, 
which you can read about here, we are focused on delivering accelerators for the following industries (but not limited too):

Automotive (Manufacturing)
EDU (Higher Ed / K-12)
Retail
Financial Services (Credit Union, Banking, Wealth Management)
Not for Profit
Health
And others

Industry Solution Accelerators enable you to build solutions on the Microsoft Power Platform that connect to your 
existing 3rd party applications, embed new applications on Dynamics 365 and extend existing first party application, 
such as Sales, Service and Marketing. Resources have been allocated across Microsoft Product Groups, Field, Sales, Marketing, 
OCP and Industry Vertical Teams to identify Partners, SIâ€™s, ISVs and Customers to partner with Microsoft to shape and deliver 
solutions on top of our accelerators.

# Getting Started

Please checkout each of the Accelerator folders to download SDK Samples, documentation, sample code,
sample apps and sample data.

# Contributing

If you wish to contribute please clone the repo. For each accelerator, please modify the files that are in the proper folder of the proper branch. So for Health create checkout Health locally. Then in the health sub-folder of the health branch, make all your changes. Each branch contains all files for all accelerators, but only the sub-folders that match up with the accelerator branch will be merged into that branch. Merges to master will occur from these branches/sub-folder combinations only.

# Acclerators
